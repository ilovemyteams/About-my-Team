And what should those who visit my website do?” The answers to these questions will give you an understanding of whether you need a website at all and what it should be like. Then fill out the “Order” form and send us your honest answers, and we will take care of everything with attention to your goals and business needs.",
        "question2": "What to choose - a landing page or a full website?",
        "answer2": "It depends on the task you are trying to solve. If you need to present a single service or product, if the result is needed quickly, and the development budget is small, then it's better to choose a landing page. If you have a wide range of products or services, or if you want to present your company and provide a lot of information for potential clients, then it's better to choose a full website.",
        "question3": "What are the terms of development of the finished product?",
        "answer3": "It depends on the complexity and composition of the team. Developing a landing page with standardized functionality and a simple design can take from 2 to 6 weeks. Developing a 10-page website with registration forms, authorization, product ordering, and payment can take from 4 to 8 months, depending on the design and content.",
        "question4": "How much does development cost?",
        "answer4": "Depending on the volume and complexity of the product, the estimated budget for a landing page starts from $500. The cost of a website with up to 10 pages is approximately from $800. The cost of developing an e-commerce site with 20-30 products and payment options starts from $1600. If you would like to get a cost estimate for website development, we recommend contacting our Product Manager to discuss all the details. After that, we can provide you with a commercial proposal indicating the approximate cost of developing your website and the timeline for completion.",
        "question5": "Can I independently choose which team will work on my order?",
        "answer5": "Yes, you can choose individual specialists and form a team yourself. In this case, we strongly recommend that you first consult the manager. If you need a separate specialist for hourly work with your already existing product - contact the specialist through his telegram or linkedin."
