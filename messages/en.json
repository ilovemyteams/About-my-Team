        "question1": "I need a website. Where should I start?",
        "answer1": "Start by answering the following questions honestly: “Why do I need a website? What do I expect from the website? What am I going to show on it? Who do I want to show it to? And what should those who visit my site do?” Answers to these questions will help you understand whether you need a website at all and what it should look like. And then fill out the Order form and send us your honest answers, and we will do everything with care for your goals and the needs of your business.",
        "question2": "What to choose - a landing page or a website?",
        "answer2": "It depends on the task you are trying to solve. If you need to present a single service or product, if you need the result quickly, and the development budget is small, it is better to choose a landing page. If you have a wide range of goods or services, or want to present your company and provide a lot of information for potential customers, it is better to choose a website.",
        "question3": "What are the terms of the development of the fully functional website?",
        "answer3": "It depends on the complexity and composition of the team. Developing a landing page with standardized functionality and a simple design can take from 2 to 6 weeks. Developing a 10-page website with registration forms, authorization, product ordering, and payment can take from 4 to 8 months, depending on the design and content.",
        "question4": "How much does development cost?",
        "answer4": "Depending on the volume and complexity of the product, the approximate budget for a landing page is from $500. The cost of a website up to 10 pages is approximately 800 dollars. The cost of developing an online store with 20-30 products and online payment is from $1600. If you want to get an estimate of the cost of developing a website, we recommend you to contact the Product Manager and discuss all the details with him/her. After that, we will be able to make a commercial offer for you, which will indicate the approximate cost of developing your website and the terms of implementation",
        "question5": "Can I choose which team will work on my order?",
        "answer5": "Yes, you can choose individual specialists and form a team on your own. In this case, we strongly recommend that you first contact your manager for advice. If you need a dedicated specialist for hourly work with your existing product, please contact the specialist via their telegram or LinkedIn."
